Chess Game
Simple variation of a chess game that allows players to play a game of chess by passing arguments to the make_move
method using chess notation (e.g. 'e2', 'e4' would move the piece in space E2 to E4 permitting the move is legal).  This
rudimentary version does not include casting, en-passant, check or check-mates so a king must be captured to win.  Have fun!
